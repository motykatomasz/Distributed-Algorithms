# Distributed Algorithms

This repository contains the implementations on 3 distributed algorithms done for the MSc Course *Distributed Algorithms* at TU Delft. All the implementations use the Java/RMI API.

## 1st Assignment

The first assignment contains the implementation of the **Schiper-Eggli-Sandoz algorithm** for **causal ordering** of point-to-point messages.

## 2nd Assignment

The second assignment contains the implementation of the **Suzukiâ€™s and Kasami's algorithm** for **mutual exclusion** in a distributed system.

## 3rd Assignment

The third assignment contais the implementation of the **Gallager's, Humblet's, and Spira's algorithm** for **determining the Minimum-Weight Spanning Tree of asynchronous weighted networks**.
